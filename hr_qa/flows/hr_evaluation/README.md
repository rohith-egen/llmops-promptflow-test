# Classification Accuracy Evaluation

This is a flow illustrating how to evaluate the performance of a classification system. It involves comparing each prediction to the ground truth and assigns a "Correct" or "Incorrect" grade, and aggregating the results to produce metrics such as accuracy, which reflects how good the system is at classifying the data.

## What you will learn

In this flow, you will learn
- how to compose a point based evaluation flow, where you can calculate point-wise metrics.
- the way to log metrics.

## Tools used in this flow
- Python tool
